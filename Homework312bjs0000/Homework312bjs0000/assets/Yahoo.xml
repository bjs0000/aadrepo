Matthew Todd Miller was taken into custody by North Korean officials after entering the country on April 10, ripping up his tourist visa and demanding asylum, according to North Korea's state-run KCNA news agency. Miller's travel to North Korea was arranged by New Jersey-based Uri Tours, which specializes in guided trips through the isolated Communist country, and he gave no indication he might be seeking asylum. "Nothing in his tour application raised concerns prior to his departure," John Dantzler-Wolfe, the director of Uri Tours, told Reuters in an email.</description><link>http://news.yahoo.com/american-detained-north-korea-tore-visa-tour-company-220326218.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Apr 2014 18:54:52 -0400</pubDate><source url="http://www.reuters.com/">Reuters</source><guid isPermaLink="false">american-detained-north-korea-tore-visa-tour-company-220326218</guid></item><item><title>Macedonia's conservatives re-elected; opposition condemns vote</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/macedonias-conservatives-elected-opposition-condemns-vote-002758210.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://l1.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/D_Oh12LgwQWO7M6RZ6pPQg--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTg2O3E9NzU7dz0xMzA-/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/Reuters/2014-04-27T175939Z_1_CBREA3Q1DZI00_RTROPTP_2_MACEDONIA-ELECTION.JPG" width="130" height="86" alt="Macedonian PM Gruevski gets his finger marked at a polling station in Skopje" align="left" title="Macedonian PM Gruevski gets his finger marked at a polling station in Skopje" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;By Kole Casule SKOPJE (Reuters) - Macedonia&amp;#039;s conservative ruling party has secured a third term in office, winning both parliamentary and presidential elections on Sunday, based on preliminary results of the ballot that the opposition said it would not recognize.

Divers found only one body Sunday after a week that saw an increasing number of corpses pulled from the ship as divers made their way through its labyrinth of cabins, lounges and halls. The number of dead from the April 16 sinking is 188, with 114 people believed missing, though a government emergency task force has said the ship's passengers list could be inaccurate. Only 174 people survived, including 22 of the 29 crew members.</description><link>http://news.yahoo.com/top-asian-news-2-30-m-gmt-023248870.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Apr 2014 22:32:20 -0400</pubDate><source url="http://www.ap.org/">Associated Press</source><guid isPermaLink="false">top-asian-news-2-30-m-gmt-023248870</guid></item><item><title>In Malaysia, Obama keeps focus on human rights</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/malaysia-obama-keeps-focus-human-rights-141300142--politics.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://l3.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/_FJ8U49Ylmn7_157obYJTw--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTg2O3E9NzU7dz0xMzA-/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/ap_webfeeds/cea97e279e2a9910520f6a7067005371.jpg" width="130" height="86" alt="President Barack Obama speaks before participating in the signing of major commercial agreements with American businesses at the Ritz-Carlton in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, Monday, April 28, 2014.

Eleventh-hour talks will be held on Monday between Transport for London (TfL) and the Rail, Maritime and Transport workers' union (RMT) in a bid to avert the 48-hour walkout due to begin at 2000 GMT, a spokesman for TfL said. The strike action follows the March 11 death of RMT leader Bob Crow, whose success in extracting concessions from employers through hard talk and industrial disruption has set the mould for those vying to replace him, trade union experts say. TfL, which argues that less than three percent of journeys on the 151-year-old tube network now involve passengers using ticket offices, has said it will run a limited service on some lines, with some stations closed.</description><link>http://news.yahoo.com/london-braced-travel-disruption-underground-rail-workers-strike-194112450--finance.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Apr 2014 19:22:07 -0400</pubDate><source url="http://www.reuters.com/">Reuters</source><guid isPermaLink="false">london-braced-travel-disruption-underground-rail-workers-strike-194112450--finance</guid></item><item><title>UK to host international meeting on stolen Ukrainian assets</title><description>London will host a two-day international meeting this week aimed at helping Ukraine's government to recover stolen assets, Britain's interior ministry said on Monday.
